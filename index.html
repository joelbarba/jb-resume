        <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
        <p>Software Engineer with 18+ years of professional experience and meaningful contributions to teams of varying size and scope.</p>
        <p>Focused on the Web Front-End development over the past 12 years, but also involved in the overall architecture including Back-End services, business logic, and user experience.</p>

        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <h4>Lead Front-End Developer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/blueface/" target="_blank">Blueface / Comcast</a></h4>
        <div class="job-info">
          <i class="icon-calendar4"></i><span>April 2016 – July 2024</span>
          <i class="icon-location3"></i><span>Dublin, Ireland</span>
        </div>
        <p>Led a team of ~ 10 Front-End developers to build a set of multiple web apps to support our <b>UCaaS</b> business platform. An <b>Angular</b>-based project, with different applications that range from web portals to <b>RTC web clients</b> supporting Voice and Video over <b>WebRTC</b>.</p>
        <p>As a tech lead, I was involved in the <b>design</b>, <b>implementation</b>, and <b>maintenance</b>, making architectural decisions, coordination within the team, <b>release</b> planning and execution, communication, and collaboration with other teams.</p>
        <p>The project was initially built in AngularJS (2016) and later migrated to <b>Angular+</b>, in a  3-year full rewrite migration process, that was progressively delivered to production with a hybrid solution to keep business unaffected.</p>
        <p>Designed with <b>reactive programming</b> and <b>state management</b> architecture, internal libraries to scope logic, latest <b>typescript</b>, and CI/CD with e2e + unit testing coverage to complete a resilient application that is now easily scalable and maintained.</p>
        <p>Projects were driven with <b>Agile</b> using <b>Jira</b> and <b>Bitbucket</b>, and fully integrated with our Back-End microservices throughout a <b>RestFul Webapi</b> and <b>WebSocket</b> connections, working as the user-end-point of our FreeSwitch core (VoIP) business service.</p>

        <h5>Key accomplishments:</h5>
        <ul class="key-accomplishments">
          <li class="">As a tech lead for more than 6 years, I was involved in the design, implementation and maintenance of all web applications, making architectural decisions, coordination within the team, release planning/execution, communication and collaboration with other teams.</li>
          <li class="">One of the major accomplishments, both for me and the team, was the success of the 3-year migration project of our main web portal, a giant monolithic app with ~ 200.000 lines of effective code, initially written in AngularJS (2016) that we did fully rewrite in Angular+ and delivered into production hibridly embeded alongside the legacy one, without affecting the end-user or the business.</li>
          <li class="hide-key">The creation and maintenance of our own UI library, which was a complicated decision at the time, but later proven a key strategy in easing the integration of our business UX into all our products, enhancing the robustness of our development and making the look and feel of our commercial apps outstand among the rest in the market. So much so as to receive a formal acknowledgment from the sales team for that specific fact.</li>
          <li class="hide-key">As an extra responsibility (outside the team), I was also put in charge of the Permission System administration. Due to both my knowledge about it and the lack of a person for such role, I was assigned the task of granting/revoking permissions to users for all our (dev/stg/prod) apps. I also took the time to develop an internal UI to streamline the task and automate bulk operations.</li>
          <li class="hide-key">One of the most exciting projects as a developer was the implementation of a WebRTC client for a Web based video call suite, fully integrated with our VoIP system, that goes from a simple 1 to 1 video/audio call that connects web clients with physical phones, to more complex solutions like video conferencing, chat and online presentations. This also gave me the chance to learn about Real Time Communication, how to use UDP instead of TCP, and extend my knowledge about network technologies.</li>
          <li class="hide-key">I was given the role of Software Development Manager for the Front-End team plus added the Back-End team under my responsibility for the period of 1 year, after which I ressigned due to a large company restructuration. Although it was very challenging for me at the time, I was also given the opportunity to be exposed and learn about team management.</li>
          <li class="hide-key">Overall, and without being specific, I like to think the greatest acomplishment in the company was the creation of a new team of developers around a software solution that was barely non existing when I joined. Interviewing and selecting the right people, mentoring, helping and keeping a great collaborating environment was the best part of my all it. The fact that our small buisness was later adquired by a giant corporation like Comcast is perhaps the best proof of that success.</li>
